Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting up your Environmental Monitoring System with Arduino IDE and integrating it with Telegram Bot:

### 1. **Set Up Your Arduino IDE**

**1.1 Download and Install Arduino IDE:**
- Go to the [Arduino Software page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and download the latest version for your operating system.
- Install the software by following the instructions for your OS.

**1.2 Install Required Libraries:**
- Open Arduino IDE.
- Go to **Sketch** > **Include Library** > **Manage Libraries**.
- Search for and install the following libraries:
  - **Blynk**: Search for "Blynk" and install it.
  - **UniversalTelegramBot**: Search for "UniversalTelegramBot" and install it.
  - **DHT sensor library**: Search for "DHT sensor library" and install it.
  - **ArduinoJson**: Search for "ArduinoJson" and install it.

### 2. **Prepare Your Hardware**

**2.1 Components Needed:**
- ESP32 board
- DHT11 sensor (for temperature and humidity)
- MQ135 sensor (for air quality)
- Jumper wires and breadboard

**2.2 Wiring:**
- Connect the **DHT11 sensor** to GPIO 4 of the ESP32 (VCC to 3.3V, GND to GND).
- Connect the **MQ135 sensor** to GPIO 34 of the ESP32 (VCC to 3.3V, GND to GND, and the analog output to GPIO 34).

### 3. **Set Up Blynk and Telegram Bot**

**3.1 Blynk:**
- Sign up for a Blynk account if you haven’t already at [Blynk](https://blynk.io/).
- Create a new project in the Blynk app and select ESP32 as the device.
- Copy the **Auth Token** provided by Blynk and paste it into the `BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN` in your code.
- Add virtual pins (V1, V2, V3) to display temperature, humidity, and air quality.

**3.2 Telegram Bot:**
- Open Telegram and search for the “BotFather” user.
- Start a chat with BotFather and send `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
- Follow the instructions to get your **Bot Token** and replace it in the `botToken` variable in your code.
- Note your **Chat ID** by sending a message to your bot and using the Telegram API to get updates: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBotToken>/getUpdates`. Look for your chat ID in the response.

### 4. **Upload and Test the Code**

**4.1 Set Up Your Code:**
- Open Arduino IDE.
- Create a new sketch and copy-paste your provided code into the sketch.

**4.2 Modify Code:**
- Replace placeholders:
  - `ssid` and `pass` with your Wi-Fi credentials.
  - `botToken` with your Telegram Bot Token.
  - `chatID` with your Telegram Chat ID.
- Ensure `TELEGRAM_CERTIFICATE_ROOT` is correctly set. You might need to add the root certificate for secure communication.

**4.3 Upload Code to ESP32:**
- Select your ESP32 board and port under **Tools**.
- Click **Upload** to transfer the code to your ESP32 board.

**4.4 Monitor Serial Output:**
- Open the Serial Monitor (set baud rate to 115200).
- Watch for connection messages and data output to ensure everything is working.

### 5. **Test and Debug**

**5.1 Test Data Transmission:**
- Check if sensor data appears on the Blynk app and verify that Telegram messages are received when thresholds are crossed.

**5.2 Debugging:**
- If you encounter issues, check:
  - Sensor wiring and connections.
  - Wi-Fi connectivity.
  - Blynk and Telegram configurations.
  - Serial Monitor for error messages.

**5.3 Future Upgrades:**
- Consider adding more sensors or improving the app interface based on user feedback.

With these steps, you should be able to set up your Environmental Monitoring System and integrate it with Telegram for notifications. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
